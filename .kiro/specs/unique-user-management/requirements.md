# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that each user gets allocated only one unique user ID in the database tables and prevents duplicate Aadhar number entries from being inserted into the system. The system should maintain data integrity by enforcing unique constraints on Aadhar numbers and providing a consistent user identification mechanism.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want each user to have only one unique user ID across all tables, so that user data remains consistent and there are no duplicate user records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a unique user ID that is not already in use
2. WHEN a user ID is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure it follows a consistent format (e.g., UUID or sequential integer)
3. WHEN user data is stored in any table THEN the system SHALL use the same user ID across all related tables
4. IF a user already exists THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing user ID instead of creating a new one

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data integrity manager, I want to prevent duplicate Aadhar number entries in the database, so that the same Aadhar card cannot be processed multiple times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Aadhar number is being inserted THEN the system SHALL check if it already exists in the database
2. IF an Aadhar number already exists THEN the system SHALL reject the insertion and return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive comparison and handle formatting variations (spaces, hyphens)
4. WHEN a duplicate is detected THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and provide details about the existing record

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database developer, I want proper database constraints and indexes to enforce uniqueness, so that data integrity is maintained at the database level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create unique constraints on Aadhar number fields
2. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create unique constraints on user ID fields
3. WHEN inserting data THEN the database SHALL automatically prevent duplicate entries through constraints
4. WHEN a constraint violation occurs THEN the system SHALL handle the database error gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want clear feedback when duplicate entries are attempted, so that I understand why the operation failed and what action to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a duplicate Aadhar number is detected THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating the duplicate
2. WHEN a duplicate is found THEN the system SHALL provide information about the existing record (without sensitive details)
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate next steps to the user
4. WHEN logging duplicate attempts THEN the system SHALL record timestamp, attempted data, and existing record ID

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data migration specialist, I want to clean up existing duplicate data, so that the database starts with a clean state before implementing uniqueness constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing data THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate Aadhar numbers in current tables
2. WHEN duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL provide options to merge or remove duplicate records
3. WHEN cleaning data THEN the system SHALL preserve the most recent or most complete record
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that no duplicates remain before applying constraints
